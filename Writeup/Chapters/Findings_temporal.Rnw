Our key findings are summarized in the following sections.  We begin by analyzing temporal and categorical trends in spending for Super PACs benefiting each of the candidates. We then take a closer look at the organizations which are spending the most on each side. Next, we analyze changes in the polling data with an emphasis on swing states. We conclude by attempting to correlate these changes to spending changes over time.

%\subsection{Type of Spending by Week}
Figure \ref{fig:temporal_plot} displays the spending in each of the six categories by independent organizations benefiting Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney for each week since April 25, 2012. The spending amounts are split by whether the goal was to support or oppose the candidate. There are three markers which signify major events in the campaign: the selection of Representative Paul Ryan as Mr. Romney's vice presidential nominee, the Republican National Convention, the Democratic National Convention, the 47\% video, and the debates.

Interesting trends can be observed in advertisement spending, and direct contact. Ads in support of both candidates show increases since the end of July. However, ads in opposition of the candidates were airing well before. You can, however, see an increase in negative ads benefiting Mr. Romney. A noticeable increase in spending on direct contact for Obama is also evident beginning in August, while the organizations benefiting Mr. Romney have maintained consistent spending in negative direct contact beginning in mid-May.
