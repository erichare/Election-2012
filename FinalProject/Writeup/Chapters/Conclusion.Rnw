Ultimately, our findings suggest that while election spending itself was a very significant part of the 2012 elections, it is not clear whether the existence of Super PACs had a measurable impact on the outcome of the presidential race. Instead, the events that garnered large amounts of media coverage, such as the 47\% video and the first presidential debate, seem to have had the most noticeable effect on the polling. Furthermore, our analysis did not take into account the spending done by the candidates themselves. It may be that such spending muted the effect of Super PAC spending.

We did discover interesting spending patterns by the Super PACs. Although Super PACs supporting Mr. Romney spent significantly more over the course of the campaign, they spent less than Super PACs supporting Mr. Obama in all but one week from mid-May until mid-July. This is in spite of the fact that the Republican primary was effectively finished by late-April. It will be interesting to see whether large spending begins earlier in the election season in future presidential campaigns.

Our analysis also makes clear that Mr. Obama's polling held up more strongly in the swing states than in the national polling throughout the campaign. This advantage was evident in the election results, as well. According to the current certified vote tally as of December 4th\footnote{\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AjYj9mXElO_QdHpla01oWE1jOFZRbnhJZkZpVFNKeVE&toomany=true}{Wasserman's 2012 National Popular Vote Tracker}}, Mr. Obama won the overall popular vote by 3.6\%. But he won Colorado, the state that put him over the 270 electoral votes needed for victory, by 5.4\%. This suggests that Mr. Obama could have lost the popular vote by nearly 2\% and still have been elected president of the United States.

Another interesting feature of our analysis is the non-uniform effect of the major events in the campaign on the polling. For instance, Mr. Ryan's selection as Mr. Romney's Vice Presidential nominee seemed to have no effect on the polls in his home state of Wisconsin. However, in Missouri, Mr. Ryan's selection coincided with a noticable increase in support for Mr. Romney. A similar trend can be seen with the release of the 47\% video. Following the release, Mr. Obama's support seemed to expand in Ohio. But in Colorado, and opposite effect is observed. The only event which seemed to produce a rather uniform change in the polls was the first presidential debate, where Mr. Romney gained support in nearly all swing states.

An extension of this project should take into account spending done by the candidates themselves, in addition to independent expenditures. This would allow for a more informed look at the relative spending difference, and how it may or may not correlate with changes in the polling averages. Another area of exploration would be the purpose field of the independent expenditures data set. Our analysis attempted to categorize spending entries into broad categories, but many of the entries in the database have more specific information. For instance, an ad buy may list the name of the ad, as well as the state the ad is running in. It may also be possible to incorporate another data source in order to link the expenditure entries with ad buys in particular states.
