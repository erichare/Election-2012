Ultimately, our findings suggest that while election spending itself was a very significant part of the 2012 elections, it is not clear whether the existence of Super PACs had a measurable impact on the outcome of the presidential race. Instead, the events that garnered large amounts of media coverage, such as the 47\% video and the first presidential debate, seem to have had the most noticeable effect on the polling. Furthermore, our analysis did not take into account the spending done by the candidates themselves. It may be that such spending muted the effect of Super PAC spending.

Our analysis also makes clear that Mr. Obama's polling held up more strongly in the swing states than in the national polling throughout the campaign. This advantage was evident in the election results, as well. According to the current certified vote tally as of December 4th\footnote{\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AjYj9mXElO_QdHpla01oWE1jOFZRbnhJZkZpVFNKeVE&toomany=true}{Wasserman's 2012 National Popular Vote Tracker}}, Mr. Obama won the overall popular vote by 3.6\%. But he won Colorado, the state that put him over the 270 electoral votes needed for victory, by 5.4\%. This suggests that Mr. Obama could have lost the popular vote by nearly 2\% and still have been elected president of the United States.

An extension of this project should take into account spending done by the candidates themselves, in addition to independent expenditures. This would allow for a more informed look at the relative spending difference, and how it may or may not correlate with changes in the polling averages. Another area of exploration would be the purpose field of the independent expenditures data set. Our analysis attempted to categorize spending entries into broad categories, but many of the entries in the database have more specific information. For instance, an ad buy may list the name of the ad, as well as the state the ad is running in. It may also be possible to incorporate another data source in order to link the expenditure entries with ad buys in particular states.
