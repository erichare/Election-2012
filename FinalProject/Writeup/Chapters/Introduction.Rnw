In 2010, the United States Supreme Court released its decision on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The decision found that it is a violation of the constitutional right to free speech for limits to be placed on money spent by corporations and labor unions to support or oppose political candidates. For the first time since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907, corporations and unions could spend unlimited amounts of their own money on the presidential election. Such power led to the coining of the term Super PAC, as well as a cloud of uncertainty as to what effect such money could have on the election outcome.

In this report, we analyze the independent expenditures data set from the Federal Election Commission in an attempt to determine the effect of this spending on the 2012 election. We also retrieve data from the NationalPolls.com database of polling results to quantify the effect of this spending. The results of our analysis suggest that the spending may have had a measurable impact on public opinion, but external factors, such as the presidential debates, had much stronger impacts.
